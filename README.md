# README

This app was built using rails 5rc1 following a udemy tutorial by Mashrur Hossain.

##Installation
- git clone
- bundle
- rails db:migrate

##Challenges
The app has a subscription payment set up with devise when you register a user.
So in order for this to be achieved the devise controller was edited.  
Ran into issues setting environment variables as I'm using zsh and needed to access the .zshrc file not the .bashrc file to store the environment variables.
